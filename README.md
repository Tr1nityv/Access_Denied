# Finance App in React Native with Expo Router 

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) to create a Finance App UI in React Native. Along with the App UI, I've implemented a custom bottom tab bar navigator with Expo Router v3 and a pie chart with the [react native gifted charts](https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts) package.

Save Sphere, a budgeting app with AI-powered features, is a great way to help users make better financial decisions. Itâ€™s about finding the balance between automation and user empowerment, giving them actionable insights while still allowing them control over their own finances.
